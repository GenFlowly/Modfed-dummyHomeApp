# Modfed-dummyHomeApp
Initial the Home APP, and ensure that localhost/3000 is free as the URL in the code specifies that path only 
Then run the project using NPM start or yarn start
Along with the Home APP , also initialize Modfed-dummyChildApp 
So that the header in the child App will get  integrated with the home page
